//Task1 : NUMBER GAME
//1. Generate a random number within a specified range, such as 1 to 100.
//2. Prompt the user to enter their guess for the generated number.
//3. Compare the user's guess with the generated number and provide feedback on whether the guesses are correct, too high, or too low.
//4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the user guesses the correct number.
//You can incorporate additional details as follows:
//5. Limit the number of attempts the user has to guess the number.
//6. Add the option for multiple rounds, allowing the user to play again.
//7. Display the user's score, which can be based on the number of attempts taken or rounds won.
