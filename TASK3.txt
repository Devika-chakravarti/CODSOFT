//Task3 : ATM INTERFACE
//1. Create a class to represent the ATM (Machine).
//2. Design the user interface for the ATM, including options such as withdrawing, depositing, and
//checking the balance.
//3. Implement methods for each option, such as withdraw(amount), deposit(amount), and
//checkBalance().
//4. Create a class to represent the user's bank account, which stores the account balance.
//5. Connect the ATM class with the user's bank account class to access and modify the account
//balance.
//6. Validate user input to ensure it is within acceptable limits (e.g., sufficient balance for withdrawals).
//7. Display appropriate messages to the user based on their chosen options and the success or failure
//of their transactions.
